# Using OCASI Without Involvement From the Authors

OCASI is designed to be deployable, understandable, and extendable by any third party without requiring support, onboarding, or integration assistance from the creators. This independence is a core commons principle and a deliberate design constraint.

## Deployment Independence

* OCASI runs as a self-hostable service with minimal operational requirements.
* No proprietary infrastructure, cloud provider, or vendor lock-in is assumed.
* Deployment instructions are simple and technology-neutral.

## Integration Without Coordination

* The API surface is stable and intentionally small, allowing adopters to integrate OCASI into their own systems without consulting the authors.
* Reference examples illustrate usage patterns without binding OCASI to any particular programming language or application stack.

## Long-Term Autonomy of Users

* The artefact contains no components that depend on a centralized registry, shared platform, or hosted service.
* Third parties can fork, extend, modify, or embed OCASI as needed.
* No licensing or operational dependence exists between adopters and original developers.

## Commons-First Design

OCASI’s utility does not rely on a roadmap, governance body, product strategy, or ongoing maintenance by the authors. It remains fully functional as a complete unit at the moment of release.

In summary, OCASI is built so that users can deploy and operate it indefinitely, without coordination, approval, or involvement from its initial creators.
